Patient Centric Care
====================




ios app
=======

>> #### What do we want the app to do? 
   Health and Welness management application that integrates data from variety of sources to track adherence 
   to a care plan. To do this we bring data in from a variety of sources including EMR, EHR, demographic data, 
   general health data including height, weight, BMI, cholesterol, and blood pressure among others, 
   lifestyle data including exercise, sleep, and diet along with user contributed data pertaining to emotional 
   states, their adherence to their medication, exercise, and diet regimens. 

   The app should display the basic health information to the users, alert them about their care plan regimen, 
   monitor and gather data about user behavior, and provide modalities to help the user contribute data via checkins.
   
   The app also shows the user their trusted circle and has a seamless way of enabling sharing between a user and 
   their trusted circle. 
  
>> #### Data objectives of the app

>>> * Care plan objectives should be synced with the provider via API
>>> * Collect / allow for completion demographic data if not already available in the care plan. 
>>> * Lifestyle data via APIs
>>> * Checkins we want to get: 
         1. Medication checkin
         2. Sync with exercise app for exercise checkin
         3. Food nutrition data either via MyFitnessPal (if things go through) or via a mock API
         4. Mood information based on checkin (asking questions about how users are feeling)
         5. Share information button with support group
